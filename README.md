# Identifying-Water-Bodies-Near-Drought-Affected-Regions
## Geospatial analytics model using Python, Folium, and Power BI to support drought response planning.

This capstone project aims to analyze spatial patterns of drought severity, locate nearby water sources, and evaluate their accessibility and sustainability to provide actionable solutions for water resource management—initially in the area of La Guajira, Colombia. However, the application of the model extends to other regions globally. La Guajira faces a severe drought crisis, exacerbated by climate change, land use —unsustainable practices, and inadequate water resource management. The Wayuu, the most important Indigenous community in Colombia, lives in this arid area. The community uses “Jagueyes” —a traditional water conservation method for agriculture, livestock, and human needs during predictable drought periods. Still, prolonged droughts, coupled with environmental degradation from coal mining and dam construction, have led to contaminated and insufficient water supplies. Resulting in a humanitarian crisis where malnutrition, waterborne diseases, and displacement affect vulnerable populations. Addressing this crisis requires identifying accessible and sustainable water bodies near drought-affected areas to support water resource management and mitigate the socio-ecological impacts on the region.
